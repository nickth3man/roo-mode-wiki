# Team Collaboration

When working in a team, it's important to have a consistent set of modes to ensure that everyone is working with the same tools and configurations. This document provides best practices for sharing and managing modes in a team environment.

## Shared Configuration

To share modes with your team, you can store the mode configuration files in a shared repository. This allows everyone on the team to access the same set of modes and ensures that everyone is using the same version.

### Project-Specific Modes

For modes that are specific to a project, you can store the configuration files in the project's repository. This makes it easy for team members to access the modes they need for that project.

### Global Modes

For modes that are used across multiple projects, you can store the configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share modes with your team without having to duplicate the configuration files in each project.

## Version Control

When sharing modes with your team, it's important to use version control to manage changes to the configuration files. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate on mode development.

### Branching

When making changes to a mode, it's a good practice to create a new branch in your version control system. This allows you to work on the changes without affecting the main branch. Once the changes are complete, you can merge the branch back into the main branch.

### Pull Requests

When you're ready to merge your changes, you can create a pull request. This allows other team members to review your changes and provide feedback before they are merged into the main branch.
