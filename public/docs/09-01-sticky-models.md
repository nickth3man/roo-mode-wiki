# Sticky Models

Each mode—including custom ones—features Sticky Models. Roo Code automatically remembers and selects the last model you used with a particular mode, letting you assign different preferred models to different tasks without constant reconfiguration. See [Sticky Models](./11-sticky-models.md) for details.
