# Roo Code Custom Modes API Reference

This comprehensive reference guide covers all aspects of creating, configuring, and managing custom modes in Roo Code. Custom modes allow you to create specialized AI assistants tailored to specific development tasks, workflows, and project requirements.

Custom modes can be created in three ways: by asking Roo directly, through the Prompts Tab interface, or by manually editing configuration files. They support both YAML (preferred) and JSON formats, with automatic migration capabilities and comprehensive import/export functionality.

## Documentation Structure

This API reference is organized into focused modules for easy navigation and maintenance:
