# Overriding Default Modes

You can override Roo Code's built-in modes (like `code`, `debug`, `ask`, `architect`, `orchestrator`) by creating a custom mode with the same slug. Project-level overrides (in `.roomodes`) take precedence over global overrides (`custom_modes.yaml` or `custom_modes.json`).

**YAML Example:**
```yaml
customModes:
  - slug: code
    name: ðŸ’» Code (Override)
    roleDefinition: You are a software engineer with custom constraints.
    whenToUse: Use for JS/TS tasks.
    customInstructions: Focus on project-specific JS/TS development.
    groups:
      - read
      - - edit
        - fileRegex: \.js$
          description: JS files only
```

**JSON Example:**
```json
{
  "customModes": [{
    "slug": "code",
    "name": "ðŸ’» Code (Override)",
    "roleDefinition": "You are a software engineer with custom constraints.",
    "whenToUse": "Use for JS/TS tasks.",
    "customInstructions": "Focus on project-specific JS/TS development.",
    "groups": [
      "read",
      ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.js$", "description": "JS files only" }]
    ]
  }]
}
```
