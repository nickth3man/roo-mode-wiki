# Team Collaboration

This guide covers best practices for using custom modes in team environments, ensuring consistency and productivity across your development team.

## Team Setup Strategies

### Centralized Mode Management

#### Repository-Based Approach
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .roo-modes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-standards.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-specific.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .roomodes  # Project-level modes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ roo-modes-guide.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Version-controlled mode configurations
- Easy distribution to team members
- Clear documentation and guidelines
- Consistent team standards

#### Implementation
```yaml
# .roo-modes/team-standards.yaml
customModes:
  - slug: team-reviewer
    name: üë• Team Code Reviewer
    description: Standard code review mode for our team
    roleDefinition: |
      You are a code reviewer following our team's established standards.
      Focus on code quality, security, and maintainability.
    groups:
      - read
      - browser
    rulesFiles:
      - relativePath: "rules-team-reviewer/coding-standards.md"
        content: |
          # Team Coding Standards
          
          ## Code Quality
          - Use TypeScript for all new code
          - Follow ESLint configuration
          - Include unit tests for all functions
          - Use meaningful variable and function names
          
          ## Security
          - Validate all user inputs
          - Use parameterized queries
          - Implement proper authentication
          - Follow OWASP guidelines
```

### Distributed Mode Sharing

#### Individual Contributions
```yaml
# team-member-1-modes.yaml
customModes:
  - slug: react-specialist
    name: ‚öõÔ∏è React Specialist
    description: Advanced React development patterns
    # ... configuration

# team-member-2-modes.yaml
customModes:
  - slug: api-architect
    name: üèóÔ∏è API Architect
    description: RESTful API design and implementation
    # ... configuration
```

**Workflow**:
1. Team members create specialized modes
2. Share via export/import functionality
3. Team evaluates and adopts useful modes
4. Integrate into team standards
